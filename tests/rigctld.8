.SH NAME
rigctld \- Hamlib rig control daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rigctld
[\fIOPTION\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBrigctld\fP program is an EXPERIMENTAL \fBHamlib\fP rig control daemon
that handles TCP client requests. This allows multiple user programs to share
one radio. Multiple radios can be controlled on different TCP ports by use of
multiple \fBrigctld\fP processes. The syntax of the commands are the same as
\fBrigctl\fP. It is hoped that \fBrigctld\fP will be especially useful for
languages such as Perl, Python, PHP, and others.
.PP
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invoke bold face and italics,
.\" respectively.
\fBrigctld\fP communicates to a client through a TCP socket using text
commands shared with \fBrigctl\fP. The protocol is simple, commands are sent
to \fBrigctld\fP on one line and \fBrigctld\fP responds to "get" commands with
the requested values, one per line, when successful, otherwise, it responds
with one line "RPTR x", where x is a negative number indicating the error code.
Commands that do not return values respond with the line "RPTR x", where x
is zero when successful, otherwise is a regative number indicating the error code.
Each line is terminated with a newline '\\n' character.
.PP
A separate \fBblock\fP protocol (-b, or --block option) extends the above
behavior by echoing the received command string as a header, any returned values
as a key: value pair, and the "RPTR x" string as the end of block marker which
includes the \fBHamlib\fP success or failure value.  See the \fIPROTOCOL\fP
section for details.
.PP
Keep in mind that \fBHamlib\fP is BETA level software.
While a lot of backend libraries lack complete rig support, the basic functions
are usually well supported.  The API may change without publicized notice,
while an advancement of the minor version (e.g. 1.1.x to 1.2.x) indicates such
a change.
.PP
Please report bugs and provide feedback at the e-mail address given in the
REPORTING BUGS section.  Patches and code enhancements are also welcome.
.SH OPTIONS
This program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long
options starting with two dashes ('-').

Here is a summary of the supported options:
.TP
.B \-m, --model=id
Select radio model number. See the -l, --list option below.
.TP
.B \-r, --rig-file=device
Use \fIdevice\fP as the file name of the port the radio is connected.
Often a serial port, but could be a USB to serial adapter.  Typically
/dev/ttyS0, /dev/ttyS1, /dev/ttyUSB0, etc.
.TP
.B \-p, --ptt-file=device
Use \fIdevice\fP as the file name of the Push-To-Talk device using a
device file as described above.
.TP
.B \-d, --dcd-file=device

Supported types are RIG (CAT command), DSR, CTS, CD, PARALLEL, NONE.
.TP
.B \-s, --serial-speed=baud
Set serial speed to \fIbaud\fP rate. Uses maximum serial speed from rig
backend capabilities (set by -m above) as the default.
.TP
.B \-c, --civaddr=id
Use \fIid\fP as the CI-V address to communicate with the rig. Only useful for
Icom rigs.
.br
N.B.: The \fIid\fP is in decimal notation, unless prefixed by
\fI0x\fP for a hexadecimal value.
.TP
.B \-T, --listen-addr=IPADDR
Use \fIIPADDR\fP as the listening IP address. The default is ANY.
.TP
.B \-t, --port=number
Use \fInumber\fP as the TCP listening port. The default is 4532.
.TP
.B \-C, --set-conf=parm=val[,parm=val]*
Set config parameter.  e.g. --set-conf=stop_bits=2
.br
Use -L option for a list.
.TP
.B \-l, --list
List all model numbers defined in \fBHamlib\fP and exit.
.TP
.B \-L, --show-conf
List all config parameters for the radio defined with -m above.
.TP
.B \-u, --dump-caps
Dump capabilities for the radio defined with -m above and exit.
.TP
.B \-o, --vfo
Set vfo mode, requiring an extra VFO argument in front of each appropriate
command. Otherwise, VFO_CURR is assumed when this option is not set.
.TP
.B \-b, --block
Use the block rigctld protocol.  \fIEXPERIMENTAL\fP
.TP
.B \-e, --end-marker
Use END marker in rigctld protocol.
.br
N.B.: This option can be considered obsolete.  Please consider using the block
protocol instead (see \fIPROTOCOL\fP below).
.TP
.B \-v, --verbose
Set verbose mode, cumulative (see \fIDIAGNOSTICS\fP below).
.TP
.B \-h, --help
Show a summary of these options and exit.
.TP
.B \-V, --version
Show the version of \fBrigctld\fP and exit.
.PP
\fBN.B.\fP Some options may not be implemented by a given backend and will
return an error.  This is most likely to occur with the \fI\-\-set-conf\fP
and \fI\-\-show-conf\fP options.
.PP
Please note that the backend for the radio to be controlled,
or the radio itself may not support some commands. In that case,
the operation will fail with a \fBHamlib\fP error code.
.SH COMMANDS
Commands can be sent over the TCP socket either as a single char, or as a
long command name plus the value(s) space separated on one '\\n' terminated
line. See \fIPROTOCOL\fP.
.PP
Since most of the \fBHamlib\fP operations have a \fIset\fP and a \fIget\fP method,
an upper case letter will be used for \fIset\fP method whereas the
corresponding lower case letter refers to the \fIget\fP method.  Each operation
also has a long name, prepend a backslash to send a long command name.
.PP
Example (Perl): `print $socket "\\\\dump_caps\\n";' to see what the radio's
backend can do (NOTE: In Perl and many other languages a '\\' will need to be
escaped with a preceding '\\' so that even though two backslash characters
appear in the code, only one will be passed to \fBrigctld\fP.  This is a
possible bug!).
.PP
Please note that the backend for the radio to be controlled,
or the radio itself may not support some commands. In that case,
the operation will fail with a \fBHamlib\fP error message.

.TP
.B 2, power2mW
Converts a power value in a range of \fI0.0 ... 1.0\fP to the real transmit
power in milli-Watts.  The \fIfrequency\fP and \fImode\fP also need to be
provided as output power may vary according to these values.
.TP
.B w, send_cmd 'Cmd'
Send raw command string to rig.
.br
For binary protocols enter values as \\0xAA\\0xBB.    Expect a 'Reply' from the
rig which will likely be a binary block or an ASCII string.
.SH PROTOCOL
\fBDefault Protocol\fP
.br
The \fBrigctld\fP protocol is intentionally simple. Commands are entered on
a single line with any needed values. In Perl, reliable results are obtained
by terminating each command string with a newline character, '\\n'.
.PP
Example \fIset\fP (Perl code):

print $socket "F 14250000\\n";
.br
print $socket "\\\\set_mode LSB 2400\\n";   # escape leading '\\'
.PP
Responses from \fBrigctld\fP are text values and match the same tokens used
in the \fIset\fP commands. Each value is returned on its own line. To
signal the end of a response "0\\n" is returned.
.PP
Example \fIget\fP (Perl code):

print $socket "f\\n";

"14250000\\n"
.PP
Most \fIget\fP functions return one to three values. A notable exception is
the \fI\\dump_caps\fP function which returns many lines of key:value pairs.
Future work will focus on making this output compatible with assignment to a
hash, dictionary, or other key:value variable.
.PP
\fBBlock Protocol\fP
.br
An \fIEXPERIMENTAL\fP Block protocol has been introduced into \fBrigctld\fP
as of January 24, 2010.  This protocol adds several rules to the strings
returned by \fBrigctld\fP.
.PP
1. The command received by \fBrigctld\fP is echoed with its long command name
followed by the value(s) received from the client terminated by a newline
as the first line of the block.
.PP
2. The last line of each block is the string "RPTR \fIx\fP\\n" wheren \fIx\fP is
the numeric return value of the Hamlib backend function that was called by the
command.
.PP
3. Any lines consisting of data values returned by the rig backend are prepended
by a string immediately followed by a colon then a space and then the value
terminated by a newline. e.g. "Frequency: 14250000\\n"
.PP
4. All commands received will be acknowledged by \fBrigctld\fP with lines from
rules 1 and 2.  Lines from rule 3 are only returned when data values must be
returned to the client.
.PP
An example response to a \fI\\set_mode\fP command:
.br
set_mode: USB 2400
.br
RPRT 0
.PP
In this case the long command name and values are returned on the first line and
the second line contains the end of block marker and the numeric rig backend
return value indicating success.
.PP
An example response to a \fI\\get_mode\fP query:
.br
get_mode:
.br
Mode: CW
.br
Passband: 2400
.br
RPRT 0
.PP
In this case, as no value is passed to \fBrigctld\fP, the first line consists
only of the long command name.  The final line shows that the command was
processed successfully by the rig backend.
.PP
The following commands have been tested with the Block protocol and the included
`testctld.pl' script:
.br
\fI\\set_freq\fP    \fI\\get-freq\fP
.br
\fI\\set_mode\fP    \fI\\get_mode\fP
.SH EXAMPLES
Start \fBrigctld\fP for a Yaesu FT-920 using an USB-to-serial adapter and
backgrounding:
.PP
$ rigctld -m 114 -r /dev/ttyUSB1 &
.PP
Start \fBrigctld\fP for a Yaesu FT-920 using a USB to serial adapter while
setting baud rate and stop bits and backgrounding:
.PP
$ rigctld -m 114 -r /dev/ttyUSB1 -s 4800 -C stop_bits=2 &
.PP
Connect to the already running \fBrigctld\fP, and set current frequency to 14.266 MHz:
.PP
$ echo "\\set_freq 14266000" | nc localhost 4532
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
The \fB-v\fP, \fB--verbose\fP, option allows different levels of diagnostics
to be output to \fBstderr\fP and correspond to -v for BUG, -vv for ERR,
-vvv for WARN, -vvvv for VERBOSE, or -vvvvv for TRACE.
.PP
A given verbose level is useful for providing needed debugging information to
the email address below.  For example, TRACE output shows all of the values
sent to and received from the radio which is very useful for radio backend
library development and may be requested by the developers.  See the
\fBREADME.betatester\fP and \fBREADME.developer\fP files for more information.
.SH SECURITY
No authentication whatsoever; DO NOT leave this TCP port open wide to the
Internet.  Please ask if stronger security is needed or consider using an
SSH tunnel.
.SH BUGS
The daemon is not detaching and backgrounding itself.
.br
Much testing needs to be done.
.SH REPORTING BUGS
Report bugs to <hamlib-developer@lists.sourceforge.net>.
.br
We are already aware of the bugs in the previous section :-)
