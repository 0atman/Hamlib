.SH NAME
rotctl \- control antenna rotators
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rotctl
[\fIOPTION\fR]... [\fICOMMAND\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
Control antenna rotators.
\fBrotctl\fP accepts \fBcommands\fP from command line as well as in
interactive mode if none provided in command line.
.PP
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics, 
.\" respectively.
Keep in mind that \fBHamlib\fP is still ALPHA level software. 
A lof of stuff hasn't been tested thoroughly, and the API may change
without publicized notice. Please report bugs and feedback at
the e-mail address given in the REPORTING BUGS section.
.SH OPTIONS
This program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long
options starting with two dashes (`-').
A summary of options is included below.
.TP
.B \-m, \-\-model=id
Select rotator model number. See model list.
.TP
.B \-r, --rot-file=device
Use \fBdevice\fP as the file name of the rotator to operate. Default is
\fB/dev/rotator\fP (may be a symbolic link to the actual device).
.TP
.B \-s, --serial-speed=baud
Set serial speed to \fBbaud\fP rate. Uses maximum serial speed from rotator 
backend capabilites as default.
.TP
.B \-L, \-\-show-conf
List all config parameters.
.TP
.B \-C, \-\-set\-conf=parm=val[,parm=val]*
Set config parameter.
.TP
.B \-l, \-\-list
List all model numbers and exit.
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-verbose
Set verbose mode, cumulative (BUG, ERR, WARN, VERBOSE, TRACE).
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Show summary of options and exit.
.TP
.B \-V, \-\-version
Show version of program and exit.
.PP
\fBNOTE!\fP Some options may not be implemented by a given backend and will
return an error.  This is most likely to occur with the \fI\-\-set-conf\fP 
and \fI\-\-show-conf\fP options.
.SH COMMANDS
Commands can be entered either as a single char, or as a long command name.
Basically, the commands do not take a dash in front of them, as
the options usually do. They may be typed in when in interactive mode
or provided as argument in command line interface mode.
Since most of the Hamlib operations have a \fIset\fP and a \fIget\fP method,
upper case letter will be used for \fIset\fP method whereas the corresponding
lower case letter refers to the \fIget\fP method.
.PP
Please note that the backend for the rotator to be controlled, 
or the rotator itself may not support some commands. In that case, 
the operation will fail with a standard error message.
.PP
A summary of commands is included below.
.TP
.B P, set_pos
Set position: azimuth and elevation.
.TP
.B p, get_pos
Get position: azimuth and elevation.
.TP
.B K, park
Park the antenna.
.TP
.B S, stop
Stop the rotator.
.TP
.B R, reset
Reset the rotator.
.TP
.B M, move
Move the rotator in a spesific direction.
.TP
.B C, set_conf
Set a configuration parameter.  It is safe to give "Token" a value of '0'
(zero).  "Value" may be a string up to 20 characters.
.TP
.B _, get_info
Get misc information on the rotator.

.SH RETURN VALUE
rotctl exits with:
0 if all operations went fine; 1 if there was an invalid command line
option or arg; or 2 if an error was returned by Hamlib.
