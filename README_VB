This file originates from a mail by Michael Benz who did the work.
It explains how to proceed to have the VB Wrapper used with 
VB.NET 2002 with Framework 1.1 (others not tested)

In the newer VB Modules (.BAS) don't exist anymore. So they were replaced by the 
Classes (.VB)
The Wrapper is not in final Condition, many DLL Function are still not covered now, 
but it will be a good start.  

To Import the "Wrapper" use the Folder "Project" and "Import existing Element"
Now import the Class "Hamlib.VB". It alsough seems to import into Sharpdevelop,
so anybody can try it out for free! 
http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SD/Default.aspx

This Class contains Your Enumeration as well as the DLLImport to get Access to the 
Hamlib DLL.

Covered are: 
	- Init Rig with Comport and Speed
	- set/ get Frequency
	- set/get Mode
	- set/get VFO
	- get Riginfo	

	-rig_debug_level_e not verified  (Function is Void, VB Dokumentation 
sais this is not possible to be marshaled, but Compiler is still accapting this)


To get access to the Class you have to add something like this in your Main Class
    Dim RigLib As RigControll = New RigControll   'get Acces to RigLib Klass



here is an Example how to use the Class:

Private Sub Button2_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Button2.Click
        'Dim tokenlookup As String = "rig_pathname"
        'Dim tokenlookup As Object = "serial_speed"
        'Dim Info As String
        Dim Frequenz As Double
        Dim ZeichenOut As String
        Dim TokenPointer As System.Int32
        Dim VFO As Integer
        Dim Mode As RigControll.RMode_t
        Dim Bandbreite As Long
        ' Dim RigLib As RigControll = New RigControll

        Button3.Enabled() = True
        Button2.Enabled() = False

        
RigLib.rig_set_debug(RigControll.rig_debug_level_e.RIG_DEBUG_TRACE)
        myrig = RigLib.rig_init(RigNumber.Text)

        TBmyrig.Text = myrig.ToString   'convert myrig to String

        TokenPointer = RigLib.rig_token_lookup(myrig, "rig_pathname")
        TBZeichen.Text = RigLib.rig_set_conf(myrig, TokenPointer, ComboBox2.Text)
        Token.Text = TokenPointer

        TokenPointer = RigLib.rig_token_lookup(myrig, "serial_speed")
        TBZeichen.Text = RigLib.rig_set_conf(myrig, TokenPointer, ComboBox3.Text)
        Token.Text = TokenPointer

        RigLib.rig_open(myrig)
        TB_Riginfo.Text = RigLib.rig_get_info(myrig)

        RigLib.rig_get_vfo(myrig, VFO)
        TextBox8.Text = VFO.ToString

        RigLib.rig_get_freq(myrig, VFO, Frequenz)
        TextBox2.Text() = Frequenz

        RigLib.rig_get_mode(myrig, VFO, Mode, Bandbreite)
        TextBox3.Text = [Enum].GetName(GetType(RigControll.RMode_t), Mode)
        TextBox4.Text = Bandbreite

 End Sub

kind Regard
