.SH NAME
rigd \- Hamlib rig service daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rpc.rigd
[\fIOPTION\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBrigd\fP program is a Hamlib rig daemon that handles RPC client requests.
.PP
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics, 
.\" respectively.
Keep in mind that \fBHamlib\fP is still ALPHA level software. 
A lof of stuff hasn't been tested thoroughly, and the API may change
without publicised notice. Please report bugs and feedback at
the e-mail address given in the REPORTING BUGS section.
.SH OPTIONS
This program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long
options starting with two dashes (`-').
A summary of \fBrpc.rigd\fP's options is included below:
.TP
.B \-m, \-\-model=id
Select radio model number. See rig model list (use 'rigctl -l').  Note:
\fBrigctl\fP (or third party software) will use rig model 1901 when  using
\fBrpc.rigd\fP.
.TP
.B \-r, --rig-file=device
Use \fBdevice\fP as the file name of the radio to operate on.  Often a serial
device, but these days could be anything.  Typically /dev/ttyS0, /dev/ttyUSB0,
etc.
.TP
.B \-p, --ptt-file=device
Use \fBdevice\fP as the file name of the Push-To-Talk device to operate on. A
device file as -r above.
.TP
.B \-d, --dcd-file=device
Use \fBdevice\fP as the file name of the Data Carrier Detect device 
to operate on. A device file as -r above.
.TP
.B \-p, --ptt-type=type
Use \fBtype\fP device as the kind of the Push-To-Talk device to operate on.
Supported types are RIG, DTR, RTS, PARALLEL, NONE.
.TP
.B \-d, --dcd-type=type
Use \fBtype\fP device as the kind of the Data Carrier Detect device 
to operate on. Supported types are RIG, DSR, CTS, CD, PARALLEL, NONE.
.TP
.B \-s, --serial-speed=baud
Set serial speed to \fBbaud\fP rate. Uses maximum backend define rig speed as 
default.
.TP
.B \-c, --civaddr=id
Use \fBid\fP as the CI-V address to communicate with the rig. Only for Icom rigs.
.TP
.B \-C, \-\-set\-conf=parm=val[,parm=val]*
Set config parameter.  i.e. stop_bits=2
.TP
.B \-t, --prog=number
Use \fBnumber\fP as the RPC program number. The default is 536871065.
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-verbose
Set verbose mode, cumulative (BUG, ERR, WARN, VERBOSE, TRACE).
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Show summary of options and exit.
.TP
.B \-V, \-\-version
Show version of program and exit.

.PP
Please note that the backend for the radio to be controlled, 
or the radio itself may not support some commands. In that case, 
the operation will fail with a standard error code.

.SH EXAMPLE
Start rigd as root for a Yaesu FT-920 using a USB to serial adapter:
.PP
# rpc.rigd -m 114 -r /dev/ttyUSB1 &

.SH BUGS
No authentication whatsoever; could be done through domain restriction, though.
Please ask if stronger security is needed.
.PP
Does not support more than one rig that share the same serial port (e.g. Icom's on a CI-V bus).
