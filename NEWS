	* Hamlib frontend will take care of backends that can't target VFO.
	* Extended API: caps, levels, parms, etc.

	* more fields shadowed in rig->state, etc.
	* rigctl now works also non-interactively
	* get_channel/set_channel can be emulated and new dumpmem utility
	* will not compile on pure ANSI C compiler, because of gcc struct extension

Version 1.1.0
	2000-11-11
	* First draft of a generic API, abstracting radios differences
	  behind a set of capabilities.
	* Hamlib is (somewhat) conform to GNU coding standards, and so it uses
	  configure script generated by Automake and Autoconf
	* Included hamlib-doc system to generate man pages, API
	  references in html format.
	* 2 new backends: Icom (CI-V) with IC706 series, and AOR (AR8200)
