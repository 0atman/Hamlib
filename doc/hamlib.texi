@chapter Copying and Redistribution

This manual describes Hamlib, a programming library and various supplied
programs, which is Free Software.  Besides often being distributed at no
cost to you, Free in this context means that the copyright holders to
Hamlib have agreed to offer their collective work under terms that give you
certain rights that allow you to modify and/or redistribute Hamlib under
the same terms that you received it.

Such licensing is often termed ``copyleft'' as a play against the common
``all rights reserved'' terms of normal copyright.  In general, copyleft
provides everyone with a license to modify and distribute the modified work
or to simply distribute a copyrighted work under certain terms.  Hamlib
source code is copyrighted by its authors and is licensed by them under two
common licenses---the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) for the
``front end'' and ``back end'' library source code files, and the GNU
General Public License (GPL) for the supplied programs source code files.
The full text of the LGPL and the GPL can be found in the files COPYING.LIB
and COPYING in the root directory of the Hamlib source archive.

This manual is covered by the GNU Free Documentation License, with no
invariant and no cover texts.  Source code examples in this manual are
parallel licensed under the GPL unless otherwise noted.

As part of the Copyleft nature of the licenses, the authors of Hamlib must
forbid you from distributing Hamlib under terms that forbid others from
exercising the same rights you received.  You must give anyone you
distribute Hamlib to the same rights to obtain, modify, and distribute the
Hamlib source code that you received nor may you license Hamlib under other
terms than those you received.  Any recipients of Hamlib must be informed
of the rights to the source code that they have received.

Finally, the authors of Hamlib require that it be understood that no
warranty of any kind is offered to anyone receiving the Hamlib source code
distribution.  Anyone distributing modified versions of Hamlib has the
responsibility to inform any recipients that what they have is not the
official release of Hamlib by its authors and should be prepared to support
the modified version(s).  This is to preserve the reputations of the Hamlib
authors and the Hamlib Project.  While it is not a requirement of the
licenses, it is courteous to offer modifications back to the Hamlib authors
for possible incorporation into their official release(s).

@node Hamlib in a Nutshell
@chapter Hamlib in a Nutshell

Hamlib is a ``front end'' library providing a C language Application
Programming Interface (API) that provides a ``virtual radio'' or ``virtual
rotator'' to an application.  The front end library uses a number of ``back
end'' libraries to translate to individual radio models.  Hamlib also
provides an interface library to several ``scripting'' languages such as
Perl, Python, and TCL (known as ``bindings'').  A C++ language interface is
also provided.

Besides the C and supplemental APIs, Hamlib also provides a pair a network
daemons that provide an API for controlling an attached radio or rotator
through a network connection.

More than one device may be controlled at a time, however, there is
generally a limit of one device per serial port, etc.
