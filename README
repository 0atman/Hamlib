hamlib - (C) Frank Singleton 2000 (vk3fcs@ix.netcom.com)

The purpose of this project is to provide stable, flexible,
shared libraries that enable quicker development of Amateur
Radio Equipment Control Applications.
 
Many Amateur Radio Transceivers come with serial interfaces
that allows software to control the radio. This project will
endeavour to provide shared libraries that greatly simplify
the application programmers interaction with radio equipment.
 

The shared libs will provide functions for both radio control,
and data retrieval from the radio.
 
The structure of the libraries will be as follows.

(1)	There will be 1 frontend library "libhamlib" that
	provides the generic API for user applications.

(2)	There will be "n" backend libraries that "wrap" 
	rig specific communications inside frontend API.

(3)	Frontend lib will load (on demand) the appropriate
	backend lib as required. 

Frontend Library
----------------

libhamlib.so -  frontend lib that provides generic API
		for all RIG types. This is what Application
		programmers will "see"

Backend Examples are:
---------------------
 
1.libhamlib-ft747.so will provide connectivity to Yaesu
  FT 747GX Transceiver via a standard API.

2. libhamlib-ft847.so will provide connectivity to Yaesu FT 847
   "Earth Station" via a standard API.
 
3. libhamlib-xxxx.so will provide connectivity to the Wiz-bang
   moon-melter 101A (yikes..)

Hamlib will also enable developers  to develop
professional looking GUI's towards a standard control library
API, and they would not have to worry about the underlying
connection towards physical hardware.
 
Initially serial (RS232) connectivity will be handled, but
I expect that IP (and other) connectivity will follow afterwards. 


Take a look at README.developer for more info.

Also, take a look at http://sourceforge.net/projects/hamlib/
Here you will find a mail list, and  the latest CVS releases.
