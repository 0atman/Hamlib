The purpose of this project is to provide stable, flexible,
shared libraries that enable quicker development of Amateur
Radio Equipment Control Applications.
 
Many Amateur Radio Transceivers come with serial interfaces
that allows software to control the radio. This project will
endeavour to provide shared libraries that greatly simplify
the application programmers interaction with radio equipment.
 
The shared libs will provide functions for both radio control,
and data retrieval from the radio.
 
Examples are:
 
1.libft747.so will provide connectivity to Yeasu
  FT 747GX Transceiver via a standard API.

2. libft847.so will provide connectivity to Yaesu FT 847
   "Earth Station" via a standard API.
 
3. libxxxx.so will provide connectivity to the Wiz-bang
   moon-melter 101A (yikes..)

These libraries will also enable developers  to develop
professional looking GUI's towards a standard control library
API, and they would not have to worry about the underlying
connection towards physical hardware.
 
Initially serial (RS232) connectivity will be handled, but
I expect that IP connectivity will follow afterwards.
