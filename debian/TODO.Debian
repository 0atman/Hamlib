TODO.Debian for the hamlib package
----------------------------------

*
We should start using dh_install and the corresponding package.install files,
it is much easier to maintain.

*
After 'make install DESTDIR=$(CURDIR)/debian/tmp', the paths for the tcl, 
perl and python bindings are all messed up. See if we can fix this.
