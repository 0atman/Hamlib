Description: Development library to control radio transcievers and receivers.
 Most recent amateur radio transceivers allow external control of their
 functions through a computer interface. Unfortunately, control commands are
 not always consistent across a manufacturer's product line and each
 manufacturer's product line differs greatly from its competitors.
 .
 This library addresses that issue by providing a standardised programming
 interface that applications can talk to and translating that into the
 appropriate commands required by the radio in use.
 .
 This package provides the development library. If you wish to run applications
 developed using this library you'll need the 'hamlib' package.

Description: Run-time library to control radio transcievers and receivers.

 This library addresses that issue by providing a standardised programming
 interface that applications can talk to and translating that into the
 appropriate commands required by the radio in use.

 This package provides the run-time form of the library. If you wish to
 develop software using this library you need the 'hamlib-dev' package.
