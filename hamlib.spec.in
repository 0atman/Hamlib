%description
 Most recent amateur radio transceivers allow external control of their
 functions through a computer interface. Unfortunately, control commands are
 not always consistent across a manufacturer's product line and each
 manufacturer's product line differs greatly from its competitors.
 .
 This library addresses that issue by providing a standardised programming
 interface that applications can talk to and translating that into the
 appropriate commands required by the radio in use.
 .
 This package provides the run-time form of the library. If you wish to
 develop software using this library you need the 'hamlib-devel' package.
 .
 Also included in the package is a simple radio control program 'rigctl',
 which let one control a radio transceiver or receiver, either from
 command line interface or in a text-oriented interactive interface.
