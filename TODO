hamlib - (C) Frank Singleton 2000


GENERAL PROJECT TODO
--------------------

1. Implement more interfaces/backends
2. Write More extensive Test Suites [ongoing]
3. Document API's [ongoing]
4. Document Limitations/Assumptions.
6. Encourage people to build cool GUI's using
   our libs. (any GTK wiz's out here ..)
8. More safe checking during function calls (in rig_* wrappers).
 
11. Add some scanning routines

13. ~/.hamlibrc and /etc/hamlibrc preferences file

14. Write the list of all functions that should be in the API,
	see common/API_Candidates file.

15. Handle retransmissions (no more than n) if timeout (->backends)
16. Write .spec (rpm) and .deb (debian) package files
18. rewrite the post_write_delay. Active delay is a waste of cycles!


DONE
----

5. Build top level Makefile for maintenance

7. Move common routines to a common area
   and avoid duplication.

9. If read from rig takes > "n" seconds, then no longer
   block on read, just return error. 

10. Improve Makefiles (autoconf?)

12. Add general rig capabilities handling. see rig.h

17a. Add support for a configurable debug level (none, function calls, 
	packet traces)

17b. In serial.c (and non serial too), use buffered IO instead of read/write,
	for better performance. Use flushing with fwrite.

18. Get CVS updates mailed to our hamlib-cvs-digest list
